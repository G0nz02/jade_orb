This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## About

Jade Orb is a project I started spontaneously, and I don't really see myself deploying this as an actual project for others to use. Maybe I will in the future, but for now I think I'll just code it up and maybe use it for myself. The purpose of this project is to help me gain a grasp on things such as workflows, migrations, and SDLCs (specifically Agile) or to improve my skills with the technologies, languages, and methods used in this project.

## Background Info (Shiny hunting)

This project was inspired by a hobby I have called "shiny hunting," a term in the pokemon community that refers to looking for a shny pokemon, which is a pokemon with a different color palette than normal and a unique sparkling intro upon entering the battlefield. They provide no advantage over regular pokemon and are only sought after for their rarity. In older games, the "hunts" for shiny pokemon would last hours and "hunters" would sometimes track the number of encounters on calculators or the like.

Because the time between encountering a pokemon would take several seconds in older pokemon games, trackers dont need to be anything more than counters that increment with a button press, maybe with a timer if you want to know how long you spent on a hunt as well. Despite this, there are other features such as having multiple counters and different increment amounts for multiple concurrent hunts to take place, or having a pokedex so hunters may see their collection thus far.
